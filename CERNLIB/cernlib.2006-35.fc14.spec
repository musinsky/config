%description
CERN program library is a large collection of general purpose libraries
and modules maintained and offered on the CERN. Most of these programs 
were developed at CERN and are therefore oriented towards the needs of a 
physics research laboratory that is general mathematics, data analysis, 
detectors simulation, data-handling etc... applicable to a wide range 
of problems.

The main and devel packages are parallel installable, but not the helper
scripts from the utils subpackage.

were developed at CERN and are therefore oriented towards the needs of a 
physics research laboratory that is general mathematics, data analysis,

The cernlib-devel package contains the header files and symlinks needed  
to develop programs that use the CERN library using dynamic libraries.

Static libraries are in %{name}-static.

Group:     Applications/System

Requires:  %{name}-static = %{version}-%{release}
Provides:  cernlib(utils) = %{version}-%{release}

%description utils
CERN library compilation and environment setting scripts.

This package will conflict with other versions, therefore if you 
want to have different compile script and different environments for 
different versions of the library you have to set them by hand.

%package -n %{?compat}geant321%{?compiler}
Summary:  Particle detector description and simulation tool
Group:    Applications/Engineering
Requires: %{name}-devel = %{version}-%{release}
Requires: %{name}-utils = %{version}-%{release}

%description -n %{?compat}geant321%{?compiler}
Geant simulates the passage of subatomic particles through matter, for 
instance, particle detectors. For maximum flexibility, Geant simulations 
are performed by linking Fortran code supplied by the user with the Geant 
libraries, then running the resulting executable.

This package includes gxint, the script used to perform this linking step. 

%package -n %{?compat}kuipc%{?compiler}
Summary:  Cernlib's Kit for a User Interface Package (KUIP) compiler
Group:    Development/Languages
Requires: cernlib(devel)

%description -n %{?compat}kuipc%{?compiler}
KUIPC, the Kit for a User Interface Package Compiler, is a tool to simplify 
the writing of a program's user interface code. It takes as input a Command 
Definition File (CDF) that describes the commands to be understood by the 
program, and outputs C or FORTRAN code that makes the appropriate function 
calls to set up the user interface. This code can then be compiled and linked 
with the rest of the program. Since the generated code uses KUIP routines, 
the program must also be linked against the Packlib library that contains them.

# we want to have both g77 and gfortran suffixed utilities available.
%package -n %{?compat}paw%{?compiler_string}

PAW is conceived as an instrument to assist physicists in the analysis and 
presentation of their data. It provides interactive graphical presentation 
and statistical or mathematical analysis, working on objects familiar to 
physicists like histograms, event files (Ntuples), vectors, etc. PAW is 
based on several components of the CERN Program Library.

%package -n cernlib-packlib%{?compiler_string}

According to the responsible of the cernlib debian package, some
of these utilities may have security flaws.

* Tue Oct 30 2007 Patrice Dumas <pertusus at free.fr> 2006-20
- don't use the same spec for epel4

  proper upgrade path as soon as such a package has been ever shipped
- fix timestamps

* Mon Aug 27 2007 Patrice Dumas <pertusus at free.fr> 2006-19
- pass --build-id when linking, this is needed for debuginfo generation
- use g77 binaries, paw with gfortran is broken on x86_64 (#241416)

  (like kuipc) may need the cernlib, but accept g77 or gfortran compiled 
  cernlib

- remove reference to %%{_libdir} and X11R6 path in cernlib script

  compiled package

* Sun Apr 22 2007 Patrice Dumas <pertusus at free.fr> 2006-5.4
